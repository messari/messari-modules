# Welcome To Messari Modules!

### What is Messari Modules?

Messari Modules are modularized React components used across the Messari webapp to display data in a contained and easy to digest way. Messari Modules are a family of compasable components that make up a module!

### What to do with Messari Modules?

This open-source project was created in an effort to allow the community to build their own modules. The module components help create a consistent look & feel and if the community creates modules that we deem are valuable, we may end up implementing them ourselves!

#### Module Part Hierarchy

```
-> MessariModule

  --> MessariModuleHeader
    --> MessariModuleTitle
    --> MessariModuleDivider
    --> MessariModuleHeaderLinkIcon

  --> MessariModuleBody
    --> MessariModuleLoadingIncidator
    --> Go Crazy! This is where the fun happens
    --> MessariModuleError

  --> MessariModuleFooter
```

### Fetching dta via public Messari GraphQL API (More information coming soon)

The project comes with a pre-configured `MessariGQLProvider` that can be used if the consumer of the library wishes to leverage the publicly available Messari GQL API with as little setup as possible.

There are two dependencies that are required to do so:

1. @graphql-codegen/cli
2. @apollo/client

To leverage our GQL API, you can visit [https://graphql.messari.io/](here) to play around in our playground.

Simply construct your query in a `.graphql` file and with `@graphql-codegen/cli`, you can generate a the associate fetch hooks/functions to use. If you use them inside the `MessariGQLProvider`, you will be able to fetch the data!
